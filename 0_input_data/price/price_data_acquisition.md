# How to obtain Price data

Data Source is the tool Agorameter from Agora Energiewende, which can be found online at https://www.agora-energiewende.de/daten-tools/agorameter

As no license for distribution was provided I explain how the data can be downloaded: 

1. Start the Agorameter Tool and select "Strompreis und Handelsbilanz" 
2. Select the respective time frame in which you are interested.
3. Select the download button "Daten" and load the downloaded file into this folder with the name scheme of '<year>price_data.csv'
